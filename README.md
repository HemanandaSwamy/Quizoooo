Quizooo - Web-Based Quiz Application
Quizooo is a dynamic, multi-user quiz application built on the Java Enterprise Edition (Java EE) stack. It provides an interactive platform for users to take quizzes, with real-time progress tracking and instant scoring. The project demonstrates a classic Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture using core Java web technologies.

Key Features
Dynamic Content: Questions and options are loaded dynamically, creating a flexible and extensible quiz environment.

User Session Management: Securely manages individual user sessions to track scores and progress separately for each user.

Real-Time Scoring: Calculates and displays the user's score immediately upon completion of the quiz.

Multi-User Support: Architected to handle multiple simultaneous users, each with their own unique quiz state.

MVC Architecture: Clean separation of concerns with JSP for the view (front-end) and Servlets for the controller (back-end logic).

Technology Stack
Backend: Java, Java Servlets

Frontend: JavaServer Pages (JSP), HTML/CSS

Server: Apache Tomcat

Build Tool: Apache Maven (recommended)

How It Works
The application follows a standard request-response model:

A user interacts with the quiz on a JSP page in their browser.

When an action is performed (e.g., submitting answers), a request is sent to a specific Java Servlet.

The Servlet processes the request, handles the business logic (e.g., checking answers, calculating the score), manages the user's session, and prepares the results.

The Servlet then forwards the results to another JSP page, which dynamically renders the final score and feedback for the user.

How to Run
To set up and run this project locally, you will need a Java Development Kit (JDK), an Apache Tomcat server, and an IDE like Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA.

Clone the Repository:

Bash

git clone https://your-repository-url/Quizooo.git
Build the Project: If the project is set up with Maven, build a .war (Web Application Archive) file.

Bash

mvn clean install
Deploy to Tomcat:

Start your Apache Tomcat server.

Copy the generated Quizooo.war file from your project's target directory into the webapps directory of your Tomcat installation.

Access the Application:

Open your web browser and navigate to:

http://localhost:8080/Quizooo
You can now take a quiz!
